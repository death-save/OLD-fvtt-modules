## How to use it

**IMPORTANT** Ensure you have logged into D&D Beyond in the same browser as your Foundry window to ensure that you have an authentication cookie for the popup to use.

1. Open the Actor sheet of the character you want to have linked to D&D Beyond. 
2. Click the new **DDB** button in the header bar near the Close button:
